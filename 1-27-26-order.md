# Changes
- Remove Worker from the site and change with "employee"
- Add an edit button to the trash and window open buddon, and if on the full view window there's an edit button there and allows the whole thing to be updated. When updates are saved its sent to the admin, employees and client.
- Client can request changes which are sent to tied admins to approve edits. When customer request changes they have to select which section to request to edit, this will be check boxes and they can check off what they would like to edit. Once saved and submitted that will be emailed to the tied admin of the work order and then they can approve what they can edit. Then client will can make changes and those changes get submitted and alert that admin and employee. We want a pipeline to protect unauthorized edits and revisions while alerting
- If there's a way to better stylize and represent the admin dashboard for projects I'd be open to that as right now it looks good and I like the ability to see everything, but it's kind of hard to know which project is selcted - then associating the users' to different groups like, admin, client and employee would be beneficial as we dont want to accidentally add a client to a project that we meant to add an employee too. 
- When editing the project it doesnt seem like it allows us to edit tje whole project please make it fully editable for the admin.
