6. Customer Portal Plan (Client Experience)
A portal makes TL Corp feel bigger, more organized, and easier to work with. It reduces phone calls,
missed decisions, and confusion.
6.1 Portal Objectives
● Give clients a single place to view status, documents, selections, schedules, invoices, and communication.
● Reduce friction: fewer texts, fewer repeated questions, fewer missed approvals.
● Create a premium “we have this handled” experience.
6.2 Core Client Portal Features (Recommended MVP)
● Login + role-based access (client / authorized stakeholders).
● Project dashboard: status, next steps, key dates.
● Documents: proposal/contract, change orders, warranties, closeout docs.
● Selections: material selection sheets, approval toggles, allowance tracking.
● Photos: weekly photo updates or milestone photos.
● Communication: message thread or “updates log” (even if behind the scenes you still use email).
● Billing: invoices + payment links (if enabled).
6.3 Maintenance Request Portal (For Key Accounts)
● Work order request form with priority level + photo upload.
● Auto-confirmation + ticket number.
● Status updates: received → scheduled → in progress → completed.
● History log (past work orders, notes, and attachments).
6.4 Platform Options (Pick 1 Approach)
● Option A — Use your job management software portal (fastest): many CRMs/PM tools offer client
portals; embed/login from website.
● Option B — Standalone portal (most custom): separate portal app with SSO; requires more build.
● Option C — Hybrid: website login routes clients to the software portal while keeping the website clean and
simple.
Recommendation: start with Option A or C (lowest risk), then evolve to a standalone portal if/when needed.

7. Employee Portal Plan (Hiring + Onboarding + Operations)
The employee portal turns the Master Bible into a daily tool. It also supports recruiting by showing that TL
Corp is organized and professional.
7.1 Employee Portal Features (Recommended)
● New Hire Start Here: digital version of the “start here” packet with required signatures.
● TL Corp University: role-based training path (Site Lead, PM, Estimator, Field Team, Office).
● Policies: jobsite rules, safety, vehicles/devices, timekeeping expectations.
● Forms: incident report, near miss, material request, tool request, PTO request (if you use).
● Daily field tools: checklists, standards, photo upload instructions, job folder rules.
● Timekeeping: clock in/out by job + job code (or link to your payroll/time app).
7.2 The Key: Keep it Simple
● Employees won’t use 20 apps. One login, one hub.
● Use QR codes in the printed Bible that route to the correct portal page (optional but powerful).
● Make the portal mobile-first (field use).
